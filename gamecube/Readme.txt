You need to use the MMJR2 build from the Retroid Setup!

Put these files into your SD card into the folders "mmjr-revamp > config"

You need to rescan your games-folder and maybe re-setup your controls. Also... go PAL games whenever possible, as it needs 10fps less to hit fullspeed without stutters.

Wind Waker runs much better, with full speed a lot of times. Baten Kaitos Origins, Evolution World and Eternal Darkness run great, with only some slowdown. All of them at 0.7 resolution scale.
Dont expect every game, though. Need For Speed Underground still runs at 11fps.
